# Lab Report 1

#### Step 1
1. Install [VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

-What I did here was open the link, click download (I used mac) and installed the program once it finished. From there you are almost ready!

2. Connect remotely using your regular 'student account'@ieng6.ucsd.edu and the password we asked you to reset in the pre-lab

-Fist I opened VSCode and installed all extentions as needed (already setup during pre-lab). Then for mac, on the top left of my entire screen, I see a "Terminal" button. I clicked terminal and typed ssh followed by my username and password.

3. Try running some basic commands like `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`
