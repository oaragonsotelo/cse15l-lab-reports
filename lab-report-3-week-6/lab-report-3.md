### Step 1: Streamlining `ssh` Configuration

Here is how I initially created my .`ssh/config`: ![c1](img_3/c1.png) 
![c2](img_3/c2.png)

... and how I was able to edit it via my built-in text editor: ![c3](img_3/c3.png)

...to eventually do this `ssh ieng6` command: ![c4](img_3/c4.png)

Now, if we wanted to create a file on our local machine with `touch`: ![c5](img_3/c5.png)

... and copy it over to our ssh linux machine with `ssh`, it would look something like this: ![c6](img_3/c6.png)

### Step 2: Setup Github Access from ieng6
